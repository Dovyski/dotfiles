# dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. Additionally I also added some config files for tools that I use, so I can restore everything after the zombie apocalipse has ended.

## `.bash_profile`

My [.bash_profile](.bash_profile) is a distillation of several files I've came across, plus a few utilities for web development. This is the overall look:

The additional utilities are small commands like `vers`, which shows the current version of some things I'm interested on:

## `espanso.yml`

The [espanso.yml](espanso.yml) file is my default configuration for the [espanso](https://espanso.org) tool. If you are not using it, I highly recommend it. It saves a lot of typying for things you do quite often.
